''' All steps are explained below
    1. Fetch the MNIST dataset
    2. Access the data and target  
        i) filter the data with 7 and 9 ( for initial development we are doing binary classification )
    3. Split the data into train and test data ( 80% for training and 20% for testing )
    4. pca for dimensionality reduction (x_scaled_data is the scaled data)
    5. batching the data ( we are not using batching for now)
    6. custom varational circuit is defined for now instead of QCNN (var_circuit)
        i)   it will be updated once we have the QCNN
    7. Input data is encoded into quantum state and then passed through the custom variational circuit(qcnn_model)
   
   8):- loss function is not minimized proply to get convergance and possible reasons are 
        i) we are not encoding the data properly into quantum state 
        ii) expectation value calcuation needs to be improved
        ii) cobyla optimizer coulen't find the minimum value
        iv) we need to check if we need to use classical neural network to extract labels from the circuit output
        
    8. loss function is defined (loss) as our objective is to minimize the loss ( Currently changes are in progess)
        i)   Function to predict the label ( 0,1) from circuit output is 
        ii)  loss function is pending and will be updated once the above function is done
        iii) need to check if to use classical neural network to extract labels from the circuit output
    9. Optimizer is defined (optimizer) 
    
    10. Testing the model (Pending :-  Improve the code to test the model on test data)
