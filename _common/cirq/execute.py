# Execute Module - Cirq
#
# This module provides a way to submit a series of circuits to be executed in a batch.
# When the batch is executed, each circuit is launched as a 'job' to be executed on the target system.
# Upon completion, the results from each job are processed in a custom 'result handler' function 
# in order to calculate metrics such as fidelity. Relevant benchmark metrics are stored for each circuit
# execution, so they can be aggregated and presented to the user.
