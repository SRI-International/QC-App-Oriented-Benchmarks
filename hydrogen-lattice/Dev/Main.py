This script is an example illustrating the process of estimating the accuracy of the pUCCD algorithm on real hamiltonians. 
The script simulates hydrogen chains of different lengths (num_qubits), constructs the corresponding pUCCD circuits, and then computes their expectation values using a noiseless simulation.
