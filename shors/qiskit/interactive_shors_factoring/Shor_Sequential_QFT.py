"""
This is the final implementation of Shor's Algorithm using the circuit presented in section 2.3 of the report about the second
simplification introduced by the base paper used.
The circuit is general, so, in a good computer that can support simulations infinite qubits, it can factorize any number N. The only limitation
is the capacity of the computer when running in local simulator and the limits on the IBM simulator (in the number of qubits and in the number
of QASM instructions the simulations can have when sent to IBM simulator).
The user may try N=21, which is an example that runs perfectly fine even just in local simulator because, as in explained in report, this circuit,
because implements the QFT sequentially, uses less qubits then when using a "normal"n QFT.
