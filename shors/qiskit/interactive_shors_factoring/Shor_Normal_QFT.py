"""
This is the final implementation of Shor's Algorithm using the circuit presented in section 2.3 of the report about the first
simplification introduced by the base paper used.

As the circuit is completely general, it is a rather long circuit, with a lot of QASM instructions in the generated Assembly code, 
which makes that for high values of N the code is not able to run in IBM Q Experience because IBM has a very low restriction on the number os QASM instructions
it can run. For N=15, it can run on IBM. But, for example, for N=21 it already may not, because it exceeds the restriction of QASM instructions. The user can try
to use n qubits on top register instead of 2n to get more cases working on IBM. This will, however and naturally, diminish the probabilty of success.
For a small number of qubits (about until 20), the code can be run on a local simulator. This makes it to be a little slow even for the factorization of small
numbers N. Because of this, although all is general and we ask the user to introduce the number N and if he agrees with the 'a' value selected or not, 
we after doing that force N=15 and a=4, because that is a case where the simulation, although slow, can be run in local simulator and does not last 'forever' to end. 
If the user wants he can just remove the 2 lines of code where that is done, and put bigger N (that will be slow) or can try to run on the ibm simulator (for that,
the user should introduce its IBM Q Experience Token and be aware that for high values of N it will just receive a message saying the size of the circuit is too big)
