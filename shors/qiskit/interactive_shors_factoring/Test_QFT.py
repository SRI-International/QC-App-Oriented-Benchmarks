""" This file allows to test the various QFT implemented. The user must specify:
    1) The number of qubits it wants the QFT to be implemented on
    2) The kind of QFT want to implement, among the options:
        -> Normal QFT with SWAP gates at the end
        -> Normal QFT without SWAP gates at the end
        -> Inverse QFT with SWAP gates at the end
        -> Inverse QFT without SWAP gates at the end
    The user must can also specify, in the main function, the input quantum state. By default is a maximal superposition state
    This file uses as simulator the local simulator 'statevector_simulator' because this simulator saves
    the quantum state at the end of the circuit, which is exactly the goal of the test file. This simulator supports sufficient 
    qubits to the size of the QFTs that are going to be used in Shor's Algorithm because the IBM simulator only supports up to 32 qubits
