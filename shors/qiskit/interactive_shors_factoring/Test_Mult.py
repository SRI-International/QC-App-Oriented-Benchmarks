""" This file allows to test the Multiplication blocks Ua. This blocks, when put together as explain in
the report, do the exponentiation. 
The user can change N, n, a and the input state, to create the circuit:
    
 up_reg        |+> ---------------------|----------------------- |+>
                                        |
                                        |
                                        |
                                 -------|---------

 down_reg      |x>  ------------ |     Mult      | ------------  |(x*a) mod N>
                    ------------ |               | ------------
                                 -----------------       

Where |x> has n qubits and is the input state, the user can change it to whatever he wants
This file uses as simulator the local simulator 'statevector_simulator' because this simulator saves
the quantum state at the end of the circuit, which is exactly the goal of the test file. This simulator supports sufficient 
qubits to the size of the QFTs that are going to be used in Shor's Algorithm because the IBM simulator only supports up to 32 qubits
