# Quantum Computing - Toolkit Information

## Running Benchmarks on qBraid

It is possible to run the QED-C Application-Oriented Benchmark programs in a notebook under control of the **qBraid** coding platform.
To access the notebooks for benchmarking and accessing quantum computers, simulators, and emulators, you can clone this repository to your qBraid account in one
click using the button below.

1. To launch these materials on qBraid, click the `Launch on qBraid`
   button. It will take you to your qBraid Lab with the repository cloned.
2. From the **FILES** tab in the left sidebar, double-click on the
   `QC-App-Oriented-Benchmarks` directory, if you are not there already.
3. Open a notebook using the Filebroswer extension on the left panel.
4. Use the `qc_app_benchmark` environment which has the correct python packages
   to run the notebook.
5. You are now ready to run the benchmarking notebooks!

## About qBraid
The **qBraid** toolkit is a platform for executing quantum computing programs (https://www.qbraid.com.) qBraid provides access to quantum software, quantum computers and NVIDIA GPUs through a development and deployment platform. The qBraid coding platform allows for automatic setup of quantum software packages with integrations to quantum hardware provided by AWS, IBM, QuEra, Intel, Microsoft, and others. The open-source qBraid SDK allows for turn-key access to quantum hardware where users can code in different quantum frameworks such as Qiskit, Cirq, or Amazon Braket. Assistance with qBraid is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@qbraid8148), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/qbraid-official/?viewAsMember=true), [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/qbraid_official) and [Github](https://github.com/qbraid).
